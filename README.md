### prompt to geneate dialogue during intake

Create a long dialogue in a medical setting where a patient is attending the initial consultation in an oncology clinic (and nurse systematically inquire about cancer patient symptoms or issues during intake). Use following example as output format: 

```JSON
{
  "setting": "Oncology Clinic",
  "scene": "Initial Consultation for a Suspicious Lump",
  "description": "A patient meets with an oncologist to discuss a lump found during an annual physical exam.",
  "dialogue": [
    {
      "speaker": "Patient",
      "speech": "Good morning, doctor. I'm feeling quite nervous about this appointment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Doctor",
      "speech": "Good morning, Mr. Johnson. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, but I assure you that we'll do everything we can to help you. Can you tell me a bit about what brought you here today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Patient",
      "speech": "Well, my primary care physician found a lump during my annual physical exam. He said it could be serious and referred me to this oncology clinic for further testing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Doctor",
      "speech": "I understand. We'll run some tests to determine the nature of the lump and develop a plan based on the results. Could you describe the lump for me? Where is it located, and how long have you been aware of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Patient",
      "speech": "It's on the right side of my neck, just below my jaw. I hadn't noticed it myself, but my doctor said it's about the size of a grape. I suppose it could have been there for a while without me realizing it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Doctor",
      "speech": "Thank you for the information. We'll start by conducting a biopsy to collect a sample of the tissue from the lump. This will help us determine if it's cancerous and, if so, what type of cancer it might be. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fatigue, unexplained weight loss, or pain?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Patient",
      "speech": "Now that you mention it, I have been feeling more tired than usual lately. I thought it was just due to stress at work, but could it be related to the lump?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Doctor",
      "speech": "It's possible, but we can't say for certain until we have more information. After the biopsy, we'll likely need to run some imaging tests, such as a CT scan or MRI, to see if there are any other areas of concern. Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we proceed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Patient",
      "speech": "I'm just worried about what this means for my future. If it turns out to be cancer, what are my options?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Doctor",
      "speech": "If the lump is cancerous, the treatment plan will depend on the type and stage of the cancer. Options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these. We have a team of experienced specialists who will work together to develop a personalized treatment plan for you. Remember, early detection is key, and we'll support you every step of the way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Patient",
      "speech": "Thank you, doctor. That helps me feel a bit more at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Doctor",
      "speech": "You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. We're here to help you through this process. My nurse will now guide you to the room where we'll perform the biopsy. If you have any more questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We'll discuss the results and next steps once they become available."
    }

### prompt to generate medical records 

Create a synthetic medical record for a cancer patient in JSON format. Include the following information: 1. Personal details: patient's name, date of birth, contact information; 2. Cancer diagnosis: type of cancer, current staging, date of diagnosis; 3. Treatment history: specific treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery), duration, side effects; 4. Current management strategies: medications (dosage, frequency, route), other therapies; 5. Baseline comparisons: changes in condition, medications, and symptoms relative to baseline; 6. Pre-diagnosis health status: a narrative of the patient's health before the cancer diagnosis; 7. Laboratory panel report: current findings and comparative analysis from baseline; 8. Recent reports: findings from laboratory, imaging, and biopsy reports relevant to the cancer diagnosis; 9. Social history: occupation, smoking status, alcohol use, and changes relative to baseline; 10. Family medical history: summary of relevant family health issues; 11. Recent symptoms: current symptoms and changes relative to baseline; 12. Physical examination findings: vital signs and any abnormal findings; 13. Treatment plan: comprehensive plan, noting any deviations from baseline; 14. Socioeconomic status: report on the patient's socioeconomic situation; 15. Community environment: description of the patient's living environment; 16. Dietary habits: detailed report on the patient's diet, including any changes since diagnosis; 17. Response to treatment: a brief summary of the patient's response to the current treatment plan; 18. Quality of life: information on how the cancer has affected the patient's daily life and functioning; 19. Mental health: any concerns or symptoms related to the patient's emotional well-being; 20.
