### prompt to geneate dialogue during intake

Create a dialogue in a medical setting where a patient is attending the initial consultation in an oncology clinic, and nurse systematically inquire about cancer patient symptoms or issues during intake. 

----

### prompt to generate medical records 

Create a long synthetic medical record for a cancer patient. Include essential personal details such as the patient's name, date of birth, and contact information. Document the type of cancer diagnosed, treatment history, current management strategies, and comparisons with baseline data. Additionally, detail the patient's other medical conditions, current medications, and their changes relative to baseline. Include social history, such as occupation, smoking status, and alcohol use, also compared to baseline. Provide a summary of the family medical history, recent symptoms or complaints, physical examination findings, and a comprehensive treatment plan, noting any deviations from baseline. Provide sample report of the SDOH that highlights the patient's socioeconomic status, community environment, access to healthcare, and detailed dietary habits relevant to the patient's health. Describe the general type of cancer diagnosed, its current staging, and provide a narrative of the patient’s health status before the diagnosis. Proceed with a current laboratory panel report and a comparative analysis from the baseline, and present findings from recent laboratory, imaging, and biopsy reports relevant to the diagnosed cancer type. Format the record to resemble an authentic medical record, using standard medical terminology.

Cancer Narrative:
Prior to diagnosis, the patient was a 30 pack-year smoker with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. In September 2022, he presented with a persistent cough and dyspnea on exertion. A chest CT scan revealed a 4.5 cm mass in the right upper lobe, with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. A subsequent PET-CT scan showed FDG-avid uptake in the primary tumor and lymph nodes, with no evidence of distant metastases. Biopsy of the primary tumor confirmed the diagnosis of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma).

Laboratory Panel Report:
- CBC: WBC 6.2 (baseline 7.5), Hgb 11.8 (baseline 13.5), Plt 225 (baseline 180)
- CMP: Na 138 (baseline 140), K 4.2 (baseline 4.0), Cr 1.1 (baseline 0.9), LFTs WNL
- HbA1c: 7.2% (baseline 7.5%)
- Lipid Panel: LDL 92 (baseline 110), HDL 38 (baseline 35), TG 150 (baseline 180)

Imaging and Biopsy Reports:
- Chest CT (09/10/2022): 4.5 cm mass in the right upper lobe, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes
- PET-CT (09/20/2022): FDG-avid uptake in the primary tumor (SUVmax 12.3) and mediastinal lymph nodes (SUVmax 8.7), no evidence of distant metastases
- Biopsy (09/25/2022): Non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma), EGFR and ALK negative, PD-L1 expression 30%

Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):
- Baseline (08/15/2022): FEV1 2.4L (80% predicted), FVC 3.2L (85% predicted), FEV1/FVC 75%, DLCO 65% predicted
- Current (04/01/2023): FEV1 2.1L (70% predicted), FVC 2.8L (75% predicted), FEV1/FVC 75%, DLCO 60% predicted

Genetic Testing:
- Guardant360 liquid biopsy (09/30/2022): No actionable mutations detected

Radiation Therapy Summary:
- Treatment Dates: 10/01/2022 to 11/15/2022
- Technique: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
- Total Dose: 60 Gy in 30 fractions
- Treatment Volume: Primary tumor and involved mediastinal lymph nodes
- Acute Toxicities: Grade 2 esophagitis, Grade 1 pneumonitis

Chemotherapy Summary:
- Regimen: Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and Etoposide 100 mg/m2, both administered on days 1-3 of each 21-day cycle
- Number of Cycles: 4 (10/01/2022 to 12/15/2022)
- Toxicities: Grade 3 neutropenia (managed with G-CSF support), Grade 2 nausea/vomiting (managed with antiemetics)

Immunotherapy Summary:
- Drug: Durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks
- Start Date: 02/01/2023
- Planned Duration: Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
- Toxicities: Grade 1 fatigue, Grade 1 hypothyroidism (managed with levothyroxine)

Psychosocial Assessment:
- Patient reports increased anxiety and depression since cancer diagnosis
- Referred to oncology social worker for supportive counseling and resources
- Encouraged participation in lung cancer support group

Palliative Care Assessment:
- Patient reports mild pain (3/10) in chest, managed with as-needed acetaminophen
- Referred to palliative care team for symptom management and advance care planning
- Discussed goals of care and completed advance directive

Nutritional Assessment:
- Baseline BMI: 27.2 (overweight)
- Current BMI: 24.8 (normal weight)
- Referred to registered dietitian for nutritional counseling and management of cancer cachexia
- Recommended high-protein, calorie-dense diet and oral nutritional supplements

Comparative Analysis:
Compared to baseline, the patient has experienced a decline in pulmonary function, as evidenced by decreased FEV1 and DLCO on PFTs. The patient's weight has also decreased, likely due to cancer cachexia and treatment-related side effects. Laboratory values show a slight improvement in diabetes control (HbA1c) and lipid profile, possibly due to lifestyle modifications and medication adjustments. The patient's overall performance status has declined from ECOG 1 at baseline to ECOG 2 currently, reflecting the impact of both the cancer and its treatment on daily functioning.

Plan:
- Continue close monitoring of treatment response and toxicities
- Assess need for supportive care interventions (e.g., pulmonary rehabilitation, nutritional support, psychosocial counseling)
- Regularly review and update advance directive and goals of care discussions
- Consider referral to palliative care for ongoing symptom management and quality of life optimization
- Explore clinical trial options in the event of disease progression or unacceptable toxicities from current treatment regimen
