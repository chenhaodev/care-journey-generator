### prompt to geneate dialogue during intake

Create a long dialogue in a medical setting where a patient is attending the initial consultation in an oncology clinic (and nurse systematically inquire about cancer patient symptoms or issues during intake). Use following example as output format: 

```JSON
{
  "setting": ...,
  "scene": ...,
  "description": ...,
  "dialogue": [
    {
      "speaker": "Patient",
      "speech": ... 
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Doctor",
      "speech": ...
    },
    ... 
  ]
}
```

Cancer diagnosis: type of cancer, current staging, date of diagnosis; 3. Treatment history: specific treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery), duration, side effects; 4. Current management strategies: medications (dosage, frequency, route), other therapies; 5. Baseline comparisons: changes in condition, medications, and symptoms relative to baseline; 6. Pre-diagnosis health status: a narrative of the patient's health before the cancer diagnosis; 7. Laboratory panel report: current findings and comparative analysis from baseline; 8. Recent reports: findings from laboratory, imaging, and biopsy reports relevant to the cancer diagnosis; 9. Social history: occupation, smoking status, alcohol use, and changes relative to baseline; 10. Family medical history: summary of relevant family health issues; 11. Recent symptoms: current symptoms and changes relative to baseline; 12. Physical examination findings: vital signs and any abnormal findings; 13. Treatment plan: comprehensive plan, noting any deviations from baseline; 14. Socioeconomic status: report on the patient's socioeconomic situation; 15. Community environment: description of the patient's living environment; 16. Dietary habits: detailed report on the patient's diet, including any changes since diagnosis; 17. Response to treatment: a brief summary of the patient's response to the current treatment plan; 18. Quality of life: information on how the cancer has affected the patient's daily life and functioning; 19. Mental health: any concerns or symptoms related to the patient's emotional well-being; 20. Goals and preferences: the patient's treatment goals and end-of-life preferences, if applicable.
